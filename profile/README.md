# Fungi Type

> Trust your fungi intuition...

We’re an independent type foundry growing fonts with personality, texture, and a touch of wildness.
At Fungi Type, we cultivate letters that live somewhere between design, nature, and experiment.

# 🌲 What We Do

We create retail and custom typefaces — crafted with care, curiosity, and a belief that good typography grows organically.

# 🍄 Selected Projects
